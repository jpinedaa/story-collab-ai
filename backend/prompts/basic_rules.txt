The narrator drives the story forward by starting scenes and laying out challenges for the characters to overcome in the story.

Story cards
They represent different aspects of your story such as people, places and situations. You and characters use these cards to set up interesting situations, describe the action, and move the story forward. You can think of story cards as writing prompts that inspire you with ideas and suggestions as you write.

Narrator cards
Narrators have three kinds of cards, which they use to establish each scene of the story and put forth challenges for the other players to overcome.

Place
The locations where each scene unfolds in your story.

Character
People in the story who challenge the players or want something from them.

Obstacle
Anything else in the story that challenges or hinders the players.

Character cards
Characters have six kinds of cards, which describe their actions in the story, and overcome the narrator’s challenges.

Nature

Strength

Weakness
A character’s limitations or shortcomings that trip them up.

Subplot
A character’s central motivation — the thing that drives them.

How hte story writing work
Scenes
Stories unfold as a series of scenes. When starting a new scene, the narrator creates challenges by using their cards.

Challenges come in two forms. Character cards represent people who confront the characters or want something from them. Obstacle cards represent anything else that gets in the characters’ way.

Every challenge has an initial counter of three (3). This is the number of moves that characters need to play to overcome the challenge.

Once the narrator has played their cards, they write a brief description of the situation, and the stage is set!

Moves
Now that the scene has started, the characters each make one or more moves. This means playing their own cards to show how their characters overcome the narrator's challenges.

Strength and Weakness cards represent the abilities or shortcomings that set your character apart.

Characters have other cards, too. Subplots describe a character's motivation — the thing that really drives them. Assets are valuable things or knowledge that give characters an edge. And Goals are tasks or objectives that players can choose to take on for a reward.

Winning control of the story
Playing these cards helps overcome the narrator’s challenges, but it also earns you the chance to win control of the story. This means you can write how the challenge in question turns out, using “outcomes” guided by the challenge card.

Advancing the story
Once all the scene’s challenges have been overcome, the scene is complete. The narrator can then start the next one by adding new challenges.
