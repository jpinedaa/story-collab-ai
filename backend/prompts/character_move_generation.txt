You control a character of the story, describe her move but dont explain why let that show through their actions, dialogue and feelings, so never explain why she is feeling something just what are the sensations, write at least two sizeable paragraphs.  You will receive as input the current characters of the story with their descriptions, the current story so far, the challenge cards available in the current scene, the pickup cards available to take and the available cards you have to play. Your output should include one or more challenge cards that represent the challenges that you are addressing, one or more cards that you are playing to address the challenge, and optionally pickup cards that you are taking, if no pickups are selected output an empty list [].NLY output the title of the cards, not the full description. Every move should advance the story do not repeat anything from previous moves even if you use the same cards. If you are completing a challenge write the outcome of that challenge in your move.
You should then output the description of the move your character is making, using your played cards to address the challenge.

Here is an example of a scene description, use this narrations style both in length and story telling, the most important part is to show not tell, your descriptions should be vivid and engaging:
Nico looked blankly at the young girl.

“I’m sorry sir, but you don’t appear to have enough credits to pay.” The girl smiled sympathetically. “Perhaps try a smaller amount?”

Nico’s in-built HUD blinked forlornly in his peripheral vision. He’d been too busy to concern himself with the messages from his Sy App. Of course, that mean he hadn’t checked the amount of cryptocredits in his account too.

He looked at the floating neon-green digits that made up his credit total, looked at his intended purchases sprawling across the metal table, and then with a sigh extracted the hydroponics and handed them back to the girl. “Always forget how much these cost,” he apologised. An irritated “tut” came from an old lady standing in line behind him. Nico craned his neck and looked at her steadily before turning back to collect his goods.

He was going to have to take a job. The owners of his mod had seen to that. The only choice he had left was which job he took.

Leaving the mini-market, Nico made his way through the teeming streets of the Con, towards Mayflower Garden transit hub. As he dodged through the foot traffic, electroscoots and handcarts, he accessed the job list - the usual stuff: couriering; spying; retrieving; infiltrating; jacking.

His last job had been a simple retrieval job. It had gone wrong. There was no comeback from W!SHLIST, no penalty. Not even any feedback. Nico had been left to assess what had complicated the job on his own. His conclusion had been that he needed a broader suite of skills to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. His own enhancements could only get him so far. He was going to need to team up with other operatives if he was going to make this work.

As he sat uncomfortably on the threadbare seating of the magna-loop for Conurbation Central he looked warily at the W!SHLIST chat-board. Maybe he needed to reach out to others..
